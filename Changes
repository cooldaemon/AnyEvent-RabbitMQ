Revision history for Perl extension AnyEvent::RabbitMQ

        - Fix on_success callback for the Channel->close method (davel).

1.10  Mon Feb 25 13:48:00 2013
        - Clarify relationship to Net::RabbitFoot. RT#71099

        - Add TLS connection support. RT#81729

1.09   Mon Feb 25 12:03:00 2013
        - Support AMQP heartbeat.

        - Support AMQP 0.9 standard. (Chip Salzenberg)

        - Stop defining a _return_cb value when not using the mandatory
          or immediate flags when publishing a message. This means that
          if you're not using these flags, but are using an infinite set
          of routing keys, then you won't leak infinite RAM.
          Currently if you do use these flags and infinitely variable
          routing keys, we still have a problem as we leak callbacks.
          RT#79511

1.08    Mon Aug 27 08:43:00 2012
        - Improve Data::Dumper options for protocol dumps (Chip Salzenberg)
        - More thoroughly eliminate memory leaks on incoming messages
          (Chip Salzenberg)
        - Properly handle channel close: Ensure pending requests fail
          immediately (Chip Salzenberg)

1.07    Tue Aug 21 15:47:00 2012
        - Fix dist by putting missing version numbers back into
          all the modules.

1.06    Tue Aug 21 15:10:00 2012
        - Fix a race condition stopping connections from closing properly.
          If you ask to open a channel, and then immediately try to close
          the connection then the not yet open channel would never remove
          itself from the associated connection, resulting in the connection
          never being terminated (as there were still channels associated
          with it).

        - Stop leaking all RabbitMQ messages recieved back inside
          a closure.

        - Allow multiple clients to have independent connections
          to RabbitMQ, as long as they all use the same spec file.

1.05    Tue Jul 22 16:55:55 2011
        - Fixed a compiling error.

1.04    Tue Jul 19 17:04:24 2011
        - Bug fix for consuming large messages.

1.03    Thu Apr  7 02:55:12 2011
        - Separate AnyEvent::RabbitMQ from Net::RabbitFoot.
        - Avoid (additional) issues when in global destruction.
        - Do not set reply_to to an empty string in the header frame.
        - Implement basic.reject (requires RabbitMQ >= 2.0.0).
        - Store server properties in the object for easy server product
          and sever version access.
        - Shutdown the AnyEvent handle using push_shutdown.
        - Be more careful in DESTROY blocks.

1.02    Wed Jun 30 11:35:32 2010
        - Fix errors in global destruction due to destruction order being
          random.
        - Fix bug if you call ->close on a Net::RabbitFoot instance which
          is not already connected. Previously this would never return.

1.01    Sun Mar 18 07:21:58 2010
        - fix bugs.
        - support channel.flow.
