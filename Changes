Revision history for Perl extension AnyEvent::RabbitMQ

        - Fix that fact that the AMQP server can ask us to close the
          connection - we should respond with CloseOk and then
          not say anything further otherwise we get a SIGPIPE.

        - Fix a race condition stopping connections from closing properly.
          If you ask to open a channel, and then immediately try to close
          the connection then the not yet open channel would never remove
          itself from the associated connection, resulting in the connection
          never being terminated (as there were still channels associated with
          it).

        - Stop leaking all RabbitMQ messages recieved back inside
          a closure.

        - Allow multiple clients to have independent connections
          to RabbitMQ, as long as they all use the same spec file.

        - Separate AnyEvent::RabbitMQ from Net::RabbitFoot.
        - Avoid (additional) issues when in global destruction.
        - Do not set reply_to to an empty string in the header frame.
        - Implement basic.reject (requires RabbitMQ >= 2.0.0).
        - Store server properties in the object for easy server product
          and sever version access.
        - Shutdown the AnyEvent handle using push_shutdown.
        - Be more careful in DESTROY blocks.

1.02    Wed Jun 30 11:35:32 2010
        - Fix errors in global destruction due to destruction order being
          random.
        - Fix bug if you call ->close on a Net::RabbitFoot instance which
          is not already connected. Previously this would never return.
